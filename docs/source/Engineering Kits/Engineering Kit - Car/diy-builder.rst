DIY Builder
===========

This is the main inspiration for the functionality of the alpha-rover project.

Functionalities
---------------

* Line Following
* Obstacle Avoiding
* Controller = Can be controlled by an app if the user programs it 

Components
----------

Main Components
...............

* Arduino 
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Radio Module
* Infrared Sensor
* Motor Driver = H-bridge
* DC motors & Wheels

Miscellaneous
.............

* Wires
* Headers 

Design and Aesthetics
---------------------

The base is 3D-printed however, any sturdy platform can be used e.g. wood 
The wheels in the video are bought online, however we 3D printed the wheels as they were too disproportionate. 
The DC motors are mounted on the bottom of the base for neatness
The controller in the video is not encased which makes it look intimidating. For future prototypes, the remote will be encased in a 3D printed case

Use Cases
---------

* Line following
* Obstacle Detection/Avoiding
* Controller

We could provide challenges like getting the user to program what to do at a T-intersection for the line following function 

Target Market
-------------

Designed for makers, robot enthusiasts, engineers, and students, in labs, workshops, or universities.
Pricing: Approximately $80 NZD, the price may vary if Arduino Uno is upgraded to a mega 

Comments
--------

Arduino Blockly Code will not be used to program the kit as it does not allow for library integration
Arduino IDE will be used
